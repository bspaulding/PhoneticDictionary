Look up rhymes fast with Rhyming Dictionary!

Ok, so its a rhyming dictionary. Why would I pay for it?

Glad you asked! Here's why:

No Ads
------
You don't like them. You're lying to yourself if you do.

Simple, Elegant UI
---------------
If babies could rhyme, they could use this app. They probably could anyway, really.

Fast lookups
-----------
Need a rhyme fast? You won't be left hanging for inspiration.

Phonetic Matching
-----------------
Rhymes are generated on the fly using a Phonetic Matching algorithm. This allows for easy updates to match results and a small app footprint!

In the future, Rhyming Dictionary will allow you to lookup many different types of rhymes, such as slant and song rhymes.

Phonetic Matching also means that matches aren't as strict as a traditional rhyming dictionary. This means you'll get more rhymes for words that have multiple pronounciations.

Offline Access (in a tiny app!)
-------------------------
Not online? Not a problem.

"But", you say, "What about all that space you must be using on my device?"

Don't worry, Phonetic Matching allows the entire dictionary to be stored in a ridiculously small package (check the app size!).
